CLI Reference
=============

The `gpp` command-line interface allows users to interact with the GPP through a modern Typer-based CLI.

.. typer:: gpp_client.cli.cli:app
    :prog: gpp
    :make-sections:
    :width: 80
    :theme: dark

This CLI includes subcommands to manage program notes and proposals.

Subcommands
-----------

Each subcommand has its own page with full documentation:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    call_for_proposals
    config
    program_note
